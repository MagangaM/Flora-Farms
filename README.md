## 1. Environmental Requirements for Rose Growth

After thorough research, our team has identified the following environmental requirements for optimal rose growth in greenhouse conditions:

| Environmental Parameter | Optimal Range | Unit | Notes |
|------------------------|---------------|------|-------|
| **Temperature Range** | 18-24°C (Day) / 15-21°C (Night) | °C | For most rose varieties, the ideal temperature range is around 18-24°C during the day and 15-21°C overnight (DryGair, n.d.). |
| **Relative Humidity** | 50-80 | % RH | The optimal greenhouse humidity range is between 50% and 80%, with around 80% often cited as optimal for greenhouse cultivation (Ludwig's Roses, n.d.). |
| **Soil Type** | Well-draining, loamy soil | - | Roses require well-drained and nutrient-rich soil for optimal growth (Smithsonian Gardens, n.d.). |
| **Soil Moisture Content** | 40-60 | % volumetric water content | Roses grow best in evenly moist soil. Irrigate when the top 2 inches of soil become dry (The Spruce, n.d.). |
| **Soil pH Range** | 6.0-7.0 (Optimal: 6.5) | pH | The ideal soil pH for growing roses lies between 6.0 and 7.0 (slightly acidic to neutral), with optimal around 6.5 (Rose Society of NSW, n.d.). |
| **Sunlight Exposure** | 6-8 | hours/day | Roses require at least 6 hours of full sun per day, preferably 6-8 hours of direct sunlight, ideally in the morning (New Mexico State University, n.d.). |

### Additional Notes:
- **LPG Monitoring:** Since the greenhouses use LPG heating systems, monitoring for gas leaks (methane, propane, butane) is critical for safety.
- **Temperature Integration:** Lower temperatures may lead to reduced flowering, while temperatures above 35°C can cause roses to cease blooming (New Mexico State University, n.d.).
- **Humidity Control:** High humidity (70-90%) during winter conditions can affect stomatal function and plant health (DryGair, n.d.).

## 4. Schematic Diagrams

Our team has developed three different schematic architectures based on the specified components. Each design serves different monitoring and control scenarios for the rose greenhouse.

### 4.1 Architecture A: Single ESP32S with All Sensors

**Description:**  
This architecture uses a single ESP32S microcontroller connected to the MQ-5 gas sensor, DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor, and 1.3" OLED display. This is the simplest and most cost-effective design.

![Architecture A: Single ESP32S Schematic](1.png)


**Connections:**
| Component | Pin | ESP32S Pin | Additional Components |
|-----------|-----|------------|----------------------|
| MQ-5 Gas Sensor | AOUT | GPIO 34 (ADC1_CH6) | - |
| DHT22 Sensor | DATA | GPIO 4 | 10kΩ pull-up resistor to 3.3V |
| OLED Display | SCL | GPIO 22 | 10kΩ pull-up resistor to 3.3V |
| OLED Display | SDA | GPIO 21 | 10kΩ pull-up resistor to 3.3V |

**Advantages:** Simple wiring, cost-effective, lower power consumption.  
**Disadvantages:** Single point of failure, limited GPIO availability.

---

### 4.2 Architecture B: Dual ESP32S with UART Communication

**Description:**  
This architecture uses two ESP32S microcontrollers communicating via UART serial communication. ESP32S_1 handles the MQ-5 gas sensor, while ESP32S_2 manages the DHT22 sensor.

![Architecture B: Dual ESP32S UART Schematic](2.png)


**Connections:**
- **ESP32S_1 (Gas Node):** MQ-5 AOUT to GPIO 34. TX (GPIO 1) to ESP32S_2 RX (GPIO 3).
- **ESP32S_2 (Climate Node):** DHT22 DATA to GPIO 4 (with 10kΩ pull-up). TX (GPIO 1) to ESP32S_1 RX (GPIO 3).
- **Common:** Shared GND.

**Advantages:** Distributed processing, modular design, scalability.  
**Disadvantages:** Higher cost, complex programming, requires synchronization.

---

### 4.3 Architecture C: Relay-Controlled Dual ESP32S System

**Description:**  
This advanced architecture uses a relay module to control power/enablement of the second ESP32S based on DHT22 sensor readings from the first ESP32S, enabling power management.

![Architecture C: Relay-Controlled Dual ESP32S Schematic](3.png)


**Connections:**
- **ESP32S_1 (Primary):** DHT22 DATA to GPIO 4. GPIO 4 also connected to Relay IN.
- **Relay Module:** VCC to 5V, GND to GND, IN to ESP32S_1 GPIO 4. NO (Normally Open) terminal connected to ESP32S_2 EN pin. 1N4007 flyback diode placed across the relay coil.
- **ESP32S_2 (Secondary):** MQ-5 AOUT to GPIO 34. EN pin controlled by Relay NO terminal.

**Control Logic:** When temp/humidity exceeds thresholds, ESP32S_1 pulls GPIO 4 LOW, activating the relay. The relay closes the NO contact, enabling ESP32S_2 to wake up and monitor gas.

**Advantages:** Energy efficient, extends battery life, intelligent power management.  
**Disadvantages:** Most complex design, continuous gas monitoring not possible.

## 5. Power Supply Considerations

Given that the Flora Farms greenhouses are solar-powered with 200W solar panels and a 12V 100Ah battery setup, our embedded system must be compatible with this power infrastructure.

### Power Requirements Calculation:

| Component | Voltage | Current (Typical) | Power |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|-------|
| ESP32S (active) | 3.3V | 80mA | 264mW |
| DHT22 (measuring) | 3.3V | 2.5mA | 8.25mW |
| MQ-5 (with heater) | 5V | 150mA | 750mW |
| OLED Display | 3.3V | 12mA | 39.6mW |
| Relay Module (active) | 5V | 70mA | 350mW |

**Total System Power (Architecture A - All active):** ~1.4W  
**Daily Energy Consumption (24h operation):** ~33.6 Wh/day

This is well within the capacity of the 12V 100Ah battery (1200 Wh capacity) and can be easily sustained by the 200W solar panels.

### Voltage Regulation:
To step down from the 12V battery to required voltages:
- **12V → 5V:** Use LM7805 or a buck converter (more efficient).
- **5V → 3.3V:** Use AMS1117-3.3 or a buck converter.
- **Recommendation:** Use DC-DC buck converters for higher efficiency (85-95%) compared to linear regulators.

## 8. Conclusion

Our team has successfully completed Deliverable 1 for the Flora Farms rose greenhouse monitoring project. We have researched and documented the environmental requirements for rose growth, identified all necessary hardware components, retrieved datasheets, and developed three distinct schematic architectures (Single ESP32S, Dual ESP32S with UART, and Relay-Controlled Dual ESP32S). We have also calculated power requirements and confirmed compatibility with the greenhouse's solar and battery infrastructure.

The next steps for our project will involve prototyping the chosen architecture, developing the firmware for sensor data acquisition, and implementing WiFi connectivity for cloud communication.
